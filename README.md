# SimpleCircuit_Zitcovich

PROJECT OVERVIEW
 
 This repository consists of a simple circuit power flow simulator. The user provides various component attributes that allow the program to follow through with a power flow analysis. The output of this program offers nodal voltages and current running through the circuit. The purpose of this program is to simulate a simple circuit consisting of a voltage source, a resistor, and a load. The user can provide voltages for both the voltage source and the load nominal voltage, as well as the load real power (in watts) and the resistance of the serial resistor (in ohms).
